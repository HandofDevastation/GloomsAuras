# GloomsAuras — Session Handoff  (last updated 2026-07-07)

**New session: read this file first, then `docs/API-NOTES.md`, then `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
then `CLAUDE.md`.** The vendored WoW skill lives in `docs/wow-addon-dev/`. This file is the
single source of "where we are + what not to relitigate."

---

## How to work with Jason (the owner) — READ THIS
- **Non-developer.** He sets requirements, answers domain questions, and does in-game QA.
  Claude writes all code and does its own research. Don't ask him to read Lua.
- **ONE instruction at a time** for testing. Never hand him a batch of commands — he tunes
  out. State the single next action + what to look for, then stop.
- **VERIFY before claiming.** Never say "it works" until confirmed in the API docs AND
  in-game. Frame builds as "the source says this should work — test it," not as done. (This
  rule exists because repeated over-claims eroded trust; see the walls below.)
- **He runs BugGrabber/BugSack.** When something misbehaves, ASK FOR THE ERROR TEXT FIRST —
  WoW hides Lua errors, so silent throws look like "nothing happens." A `StopMovingAndSizing`
  typo cost hours because I didn't ask for the error early.
- These are also saved as memories (jason-non-developer, one-instruction-at-a-time,
  enable-lua-errors-during-qa, verify-before-claiming).

## Project & environment
- **GloomsAuras**: bespoke WoW **Midnight (Interface 120007)** addon — custom textures/sounds
  that trigger on Cooldown Manager state. Sibling to GloomsBuildBarn (same author "Gloom",
  guild Hand of Devastation). Spec origin: `~/Downloads/HoDTracker-SPEC.md` (ignore the name).
- **Repo root = addon folder**: `/Users/jasonstone/GloomsAuras` (the primary cwd).
- **Live in client via symlink**: `/Applications/World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/GloomsAuras`
  → repo root. Edits are live; Jason just `/reload`s. No copy step.
- **Blizzard source on disk** for verifying APIs: `_retail_/BlizzardInterfaceCode/Interface/AddOns/`
  (esp. `Blizzard_CooldownViewer/` and `Blizzard_APIDocumentationGenerated/`). USE IT.
- **Always `luac -p <file>`** before handing code to Jason.

## The core idea (do NOT relitigate)
Midnight makes combat aura/cooldown data **secret** (`issecretvalue`); tainted addon code
throws if it does arithmetic/compare/etc. on a secret. **GloomsAuras never reads that data —
it MIRRORS the Blizzard Cooldown Manager**, whose state is computed in Blizzard's *secure*
context and exposed as plain frame state / transitions we can hook. **Only spells actually
PLACED in a CDM viewer are trackable** (registry ≠ placed).

## Files
- `GloomsAuras.toc` — Interface 120007; load order: `Libs\*` → Core → Displays → CDM →
  `Media\TextureManifest.lua` → Config.
- `Core.lua` — namespace `GA` (`_G.GloomsAuras`), SavedVariables `GloomsAurasDB`, `/ga` router,
  **design tokens** `GA.COLOR / GA.FONT / GA.MEDIA` (matched to Build Barn).
- `Displays.lua` — `GA.Displays`: on-screen frames (texture/size/pos/alpha + tint/desaturate/blend/
  strata), drag-to-move while panel open (NOT clamped — auras may go off-screen), Cooldown swipe (OOC).
- `CDM.lua` — `GA.CDM`: the mirror engine — state tracking, trigger evaluation, discovery, hooks.
- `Config.lua` — `GA.Config`: the whole GUI toolkit (`flatButton/flatCheck/flatEditBox/MakeSlider/
  MakeColor/MakeCycle/skinPlate/addEdges`) + two-pane panel + aura picker + **texture picker** +
  trigger editor.
- `Media/TextureManifest.lua` — auto-generated `GA.TextureShapes` (254 aura shapes). Regenerate via
  `scratchpad/gen_manifest.py` if the bundled art changes.
- `Media/` — bundled Khand/GeneralSans fonts, `bg_flame.png`, `Textures/` (107 shape files) +
  `PowerAurasMedia/Auras/` (145 curls) — copied from ThisWeeksAuras.
- `MinimapButton.lua` — `GA:InitMinimapButton` / `GA:ToggleMinimapButton` (LibDBIcon launcher).
- `Libs/` — embedded LibStub, CallbackHandler-1.0, LibDataBroker-1.1, LibDBIcon-1.0,
  LibSharedMedia-3.0 (source: TWA's copies).

## What's BUILT + QA status
- ✅ **QA'd** Buff mirror — Trick Shots texture shows while buff active (in combat).
- ✅ **QA'd** Options panel — texture path, width/height, X/Y, alpha; each control = slider +
  −/+ steppers + numeric box; movable window; remembers position.
- ✅ **QA'd** Aura picker — "Browse auras" scroll list of the CDM registry (icon+name), click to add.
- ✅ **QA'd** Drag-to-position auras (while panel open), synced with the X/Y numbers.
- ✅ **QA'd** Cooldown availability mirror for **non-charge** cooldowns (Rapid Fire) — shows when
  ready, hides on cooldown, in combat.
- ✅ **QA'd** Conditions/Trigger system — per-display trigger: conditions on any spells, combined
  AND/OR; Trigger editor UI (Edit Trigger… button → editor window). Full sweep passed 2026-07-07:
  all four leaf types (buff_active, buff_inactive, cd_ready, cd_oncd) + both AND and OR logic, in
  combat. Data structured so it can grow to nested/mixed groups later.
- ✅ **QA'd** Panel restyle (2026-07-07) — two-pane layout: LEFT = scrollable list of created
  displays (replaces the old `< prev / next >` scrubber), RIGHT = the settings editor. Skinned
  to match GloomsBuildBarn (navy plate, purple accents, bundled Khand/GeneralSans fonts in
  `Media/`, flat buttons). Picker + trigger-editor windows reskinned to match.
- ✅ **QA'd** Display render options (2026-07-07) — Tint (opens ColorPickerFrame), Desaturate,
  Blend Mode (Blend/Add/Modulate/Alpha Key/Opaque), Frame Strata. All pure rendering.
- ✅ **QA'd** Texture picker (2026-07-07) — "Choose…" button → window with a category dropdown +
  search + scrollable grid + live preview swatch. Categories: **254 bundled aura shapes** (Shapes,
  PowerAuras Heads-Up/Icons/Separated/Words, Beams, Sparks, Runes), **Game Icons** (all game icons
  via `GetMacroIcons`/`GetLooseMacroIcons`), **StoneTweaks Graphics** (read from `StoneTweaksDB`,
  by path), **Shared Media (bars)** (LibSharedMedia — bar textures only).
- ✅ **QA'd** Flat input styling (no `InputBoxTemplate`), size cap raised **512 → 8192** + offsets
  ±4000 (for 4K), display frames **un-clamped** so auras can sit partially/fully off-screen.
- ✅ **QA'd** Per-display sound picker (2026-07-07) — "Sound" button → picker window (LibSharedMedia
  sounds + None, click-to-preview, draggable scrollbar) + a Test button. `cfg.sound = {file,name,
  channel}`; fires on hidden→shown via `CDM:PlaySound` (throttled). NOTE: **no per-sound volume** —
  `PlaySoundFile` takes only (file, channel); the only volume lever is WoW's global channel sliders.
- ✅ **QA'd** Minimap button (2026-07-07) — `MinimapButton.lua` via LibDBIcon/LibDataBroker (embedded),
  uses `Media/minimap.png` (Jason's 256×256 icon; also wired as `## IconTexture`). Left-click opens
  the panel; `/ga minimap` toggles; pos+hide saved in `db.minimap`. Self-contained fallback if libs absent.
- ✅ **QA'd** Visibility system (2026-07-07) — per-display player/game-state gate that **ANDs with the
  Trigger**. "Visibility…" editor: Combat/Target 3-way, toggles (casting, mounted, vehicle, instance,
  encounter, resting, stealthed, group, raid, warmode, alive), **Specialization** multi-select,
  **Spell/Talent known**. Engine = `CDM:VisibilityGate` + a 0.2s poll (`UpdateVisibilityPoll`) that
  runs only while some display uses visibility. All plain game APIs (no secret data). See learnings.

## Hard-won LEARNINGS (verified — do NOT rediscover)
- The frame method is **`StopMovingOrSizing`**, NOT `StopMovingAndSizing` (nonexistent). The
  typo made every drag "stick to the cursor." Cross-check method names against GloomsBuildBarn.
- **Create frames HIDDEN** (`f:Hide()` at end of build) so the first `:Show()` actually
  transitions and fires `OnShow` — otherwise "have to open it twice to populate" bugs.
- `Button:SetScript("OnClick", fn)` calls `fn(button, ...)` — passing a bare function whose
  first param means something else gets the button as that arg (caused the OpenPicker crash).
  Wrap: `function() fn() end`.
- **Buff active-state**: `item:IsActive()` is a **plain bool in open-world combat** (confirmed).
  Mirror via `hooksecurefunc(itemFrame, "OnActiveStateChanged", …)`.
- **Non-charge cooldown availability WORKS**: hook globals `CooldownFrame_Set`/`CooldownFrame_Clear`
  filtered to `item:GetCooldownFrame()`, plus `item:OnCooldownDone`. Seed initial state OOC via
  `GetSpellCooldown`. Never reads a secret.
- **Trigger `nil`-availability default (fixed 2026-07-07):** an idle-available cooldown never fires
  a transition and is secret in combat, so `available[sid]` stays **nil**. `EvalDisplay` (auto,
  no-trigger) already defaulted nil→ready, but `EvalCondition` (cd_ready as a trigger condition)
  defaulted nil→NOT-ready — same value, opposite meaning. Compound "RF cd_ready AND …" silently
  failed. Fix: `cd_ready` now defaults nil→READY **for non-charge only** (charge stays nil→not-ready,
  since charges are genuinely unreadable). Lesson: the two eval paths must agree on unknown-state.
- **GCD false-positive on `CooldownFrame_Set` (fixed 2026-07-07):** every cast triggers the global
  cooldown, and the CDM re-runs `CooldownFrame_Set` on each item's widget to redraw — even for a
  spell NOT on its own cd. The hook was marking it unavailable, sticking it "on cooldown" until a
  real off-cd transition (this is why casting Aimed Shot/Multi-Shot broke Rapid Fire's condition).
  Fix: the Set hook now **skips while `item.isOnGCD == true`** (plain bool, guarded), keyed via a
  new `cdFrameToItem` map. Also reseed availability on `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`. TRADE-OFF: casting
  the tracked cd spell *itself* now leaves its aura lit ~1.5s (the GCD) before it flips to on-cd.
- **`/ga trace`** (new): focused per-display dump — shown?, our `buffActive`/`available` mirror,
  the item's cached `isOnGCD`/`isOnActualCooldown`/`cooldownIsActive`, and each trigger condition's
  evaluated result. Ask Jason to run it IN the failing state — it makes trigger bugs a 30-sec find.
- **WALLS (confirmed from client docs — cannot out-code):**
  - **Cooldown timers in combat**: every `SetCooldown*` is `AllowedWhenUntainted` → an addon
    can't feed a secret duration to a timer widget. Works out of combat only.
  - **Charge-spell availability**: `GetSpellCharges` AND `GetSpellCastCount` are both
    `SecretWhenCooldownsRestricted`; `IsSpellUsable` ignores cooldown AND charges (always true).
    So "do I have a charge" is unknowable in combat. Aimed Shot etc. can't do "available."
  - Only partial charge signal: `C_SpellActivationOverlay` detects **procs** — but procs that
    grant a buff (e.g. Lock and Load) are already trackable as a **buff-active** condition, so
    that path is redundant.
- **Placement requirement**: a spell must be placed on a CDM viewer (Edit Mode → Cooldown
  Manager), not merely in the registry, to be tracked. `/ga charges` reports charge status;
  `/ga debug` shows FOUND/NOT FOUND + state.

## Diagnostics / commands
- `/ga` — open the options panel. `/ga help` — list commands.
- `/ga debug` — CDM state dump (availability/kind/charge/IsSpellUsable per display). Ask Jason
  to paste this (or BugSack) when diagnosing.
- `/ga minimap` — show/hide the minimap button (persisted).
- `/ga charges` — which cooldowns support availability tracking (charge spells flagged). Run OOC.
- `/ga trace` — per-display trigger diagnostic (shown?, buffActive/available mirror, item cooldown
  fields, each condition's eval). Run IN the failing state; makes trigger bugs a 30-sec find.
- `/ga add|remove|list|pos|size|preview|test` — legacy/back-door commands (panel is primary).

## SavedVariables data model  `GloomsAurasDB.displays[spellID]`
```
{ spellID, label, enabled=true, width=64, height=64, point={"CENTER",x,y}, alpha=1,
  showLabel=true, texture = <path/fileID or nil=spell icon>,
  color = {r,g,b} or nil,  desaturate = bool/nil,  blend = <mode or nil=BLEND>,
  strata = <mode or nil=HIGH>,  sound = { file, name, channel } or nil,
  trigger = { logic="AND"|"OR", conditions = { { spellID, state, name }, ... } },
  visibility = { combat="in"|"out"|nil, target="has"|"none"|nil, casting/mounted/vehicle/
    instance/encounter/resting/stealthed/group/raid/warmode/alive = true/nil,
    specs = { [specID]=true } or nil, spellKnown = spellID or nil } }
```
`GloomsAurasDB.minimap = { hide, minimapPos }` (LibDBIcon). Display shows when its **Trigger**
passes AND its **Visibility** gate passes (no visibility set ⇒ always eligible).
`state` ∈ `buff_active | buff_inactive | cd_ready | cd_oncd`. No trigger ⇒ auto-behavior
(display's own spell: buff→active, cooldown→available). Width/Height range 8–8192, offsets ±4000.
`GloomsAurasDB.panelPos` stores the panel location; `db.schema`, `db.media` reserved.

## Texture picker sourcing (verified 2026-07-07 — do NOT relitigate)
- **Game icons** are enumerable from the client: `GetMacroIcons`/`GetLooseMacroIcons`(+Item variants)
  fill a table with fileIDs + loose `Interface\ICONS\<name>` strings (Blizzard's own IconDataProvider
  pattern). No names to search by → browse-only.
- **The pretty aura shapes are NOT game files** — they're bundled inside WeakAuras/PowerAuras/TWA.
  We bundled them (copied TWA's `Media/Textures` + `PowerAurasMedia/Auras`, generated the manifest
  from TWA's `Private.texture_types`, rewrote paths TWA→GloomsAuras). No-extension `.tga` paths
  render fine in this client (mirrors TWA's working setup verbatim).
- **LibSharedMedia only carries bar/border/background textures**, not aura shapes — so its category
  is bar textures. StoneTweaks registers its *Textures* there as `statusbar`.
- **StoneTweaks Graphics** (the useful custom art) are NOT in LSM; they're files listed in
  `StoneTweaksDB.graphics` = array of `{name,file}`, path `Interface\AddOns\StoneTweaks\Graphics\<file>`.
  We read that table live at picker-open (reading another addon's SavedVariables global is fine).

## NEXT / pending (Jason: "build order doesn't matter, whatever makes sense")
1. ✅ DONE (2026-07-07) — Full QA sweep of the Trigger system (all 4 leaf types + AND/OR).
2. ✅ DONE (2026-07-07) — Texture picker + render options (tint/desaturate/blend/strata) + shapes.
3. ✅ DONE (2026-07-07) — Sound picker, Minimap button, Visibility system.
4. **Deferred texture transforms** — Mirror, Rotation, Texture Wrap (skipped; SetRotation interacts
   with SetTexCoord so test carefully). Rotation is useful for orienting shapes/beams.
5. **Visibility Phase 2** (if wanted) — the rarer WeakAuras load conditions: Player Race/Faction/
   Level, Zone/Instance-type/difficulty, Mythic+ affix, Equipment, Spec Role, PvP talent. All plain
   APIs; just longer UI. (Dropped **Skyriding** — no reliable "am I skyriding now" API; only
   `IsAdvancedFlyableArea` which is about the zone.)
6. **Text overlays** (manual text e.g. keybind) + LSM **font** picker (would also surface Jason's
   StoneTweaks fonts, already in LSM as "font").
7. **Requested feature idea:** a toggle to hide the Blizzard CDM viewers (alpha-0, NOT Hide();
   verify it doesn't break tracking or fight Edit Mode).
8. Export/import strings for sharing (later).

## Current in-game context
- Jason plays **Marksmanship Hunter**. Relevant IDs: Trick Shots buff **257621**, Rapid Fire
  **257044** (non-charge cd, works), Aimed Shot **19434** (2 charges — availability walled),
  Lock and Load **194595** (a buff). His SavedVariables currently has displays for Trick Shots,
  Rapid Fire, and Aimed Shot (the Aimed Shot one has a compound trigger that can't work due to
  charges — fine to reconfigure), plus texture/visibility experiments from this session.
- **Session end 2026-07-07:** shipped the texture picker + 254 bundled shapes, display render
  options, per-display sound picker, minimap button, and the Visibility system — all QA'd. Repo is
  now under **git** (first commit this session). No open bugs. Next feature is Jason's pick from the
  pending list (deferred texture transforms / Visibility Phase 2 / text overlays are the front-runners).

## Git / packaging
Now a **git repo** (initialized 2026-07-07). Mirrors GloomsBuildBarn's setup:
- `.gitignore` excludes `.DS_Store`, `/.release/`, `Libs/` (see below), `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- `.pkgmeta` (BigWigs packager) `package-as: GloomsAuras`; **`Libs/` is NOT committed** — the packager
  fetches LibStub/CallbackHandler/LibDataBroker/LibDBIcon/LibSharedMedia into `Libs/` at release time.
  Jason's live working copy keeps its `Libs/` (gitignore doesn't delete), so nothing breaks locally.
- **Committed** bundled art: `Media/` (fonts, `bg_flame.png`, `minimap.png`, `Textures/`,
  `TextureManifest.lua`) + `PowerAurasMedia/Auras/`. These are ours, not packager-fetched.
- **Push status:** committed locally on `main`; remote `origin` set to
  `https://github.com/HandofDevastation/GloomsAuras.git`. A push attempt **authenticated fine**
  (creds cached) but returned **"Repository not found"** — the GitHub repo doesn't exist yet. Next:
  create it (github.com/new → owner `HandofDevastation`, name `GloomsAuras`, don't add a README), then
  `git push -u origin main`. NOTE before making it public: the repo bundles WeakAuras/PowerAuras
  textures (GPL-family) — fine for guild use, worth a license glance if published widely.
