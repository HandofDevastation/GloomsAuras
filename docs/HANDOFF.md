# GloomsAuras — Session Handoff  (last updated 2026-07-08)

**New session: read this file first, then `docs/API-NOTES.md`, then `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
then `CLAUDE.md`.** The vendored WoW skill lives in `docs/wow-addon-dev/`. This file is the
single source of "where we are + what not to relitigate."

---

## How to work with Jason (the owner) — READ THIS
- **Non-developer.** He sets requirements, answers domain questions, and does in-game QA.
  Claude writes all code and does its own research. Don't ask him to read Lua.
- **ONE instruction at a time** for testing. Never hand him a batch of commands — he tunes
  out. State the single next action + what to look for, then stop.
- **VERIFY before claiming.** Never say "it works" until confirmed in the API docs AND
  in-game. Frame builds as "the source says this should work — test it," not as done. (This
  rule exists because repeated over-claims eroded trust; see the walls below.)
- **He runs BugGrabber/BugSack.** When something misbehaves, ASK FOR THE ERROR TEXT FIRST —
  WoW hides Lua errors, so silent throws look like "nothing happens." A `StopMovingAndSizing`
  typo cost hours because I didn't ask for the error early.
- These are also saved as memories (jason-non-developer, one-instruction-at-a-time,
  enable-lua-errors-during-qa, verify-before-claiming).

## Project & environment
- **GloomsAuras**: bespoke WoW **Midnight (Interface 120007)** addon — custom textures/sounds
  that trigger on Cooldown Manager state. Sibling to GloomsBuildBarn (same author "Gloom",
  guild Hand of Devastation). Spec origin: `~/Downloads/HoDTracker-SPEC.md` (ignore the name).
- **Repo root = addon folder**: `/Users/jasonstone/GloomsAuras` (the primary cwd).
- **Live in client via symlink**: `/Applications/World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/GloomsAuras`
  → repo root. Edits are live; Jason just `/reload`s. No copy step.
- **Blizzard source on disk** for verifying APIs: `_retail_/BlizzardInterfaceCode/Interface/AddOns/`
  (esp. `Blizzard_CooldownViewer/` and `Blizzard_APIDocumentationGenerated/`). USE IT.
- **Always `luac -p <file>`** before handing code to Jason.

## The core idea (do NOT relitigate)
Midnight makes combat aura/cooldown data **secret** (`issecretvalue`); tainted addon code
throws if it does arithmetic/compare/etc. on a secret. **GloomsAuras never reads that data —
it MIRRORS the Blizzard Cooldown Manager**, whose state is computed in Blizzard's *secure*
context and exposed as plain frame state / transitions we can hook. **Only spells actually
PLACED in a CDM viewer are trackable** (registry ≠ placed).

> **UPDATE 2026-07-08 (VERIFIED — the rule was too strict; stop apologizing for "breaking" it).**
> The real constraint is ONLY "no arithmetic/compare/truth-test on a secret." We MAY read an aura's
> **presence** (via the CDM item's native `frame.auraInstanceID` — secret or not, its *existence* is
> the signal) and **duration** (via `C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDuration` duration OBJECTS), choosing the unit
> from `info.selfAura`. This is **PROVEN for target DoTs** (Warlock, open-world, 8 `/ga probe` captures
> across target swaps) and is how we'll fix DoT tracking — the pure `IsActive()` mirror gets target
> swaps WRONG. Mirroring is still correct for buffs/cooldowns; this just adds a sanctioned, tested path
> for auras the mirror can't handle. A charge variant (shadow-cooldown) is FOUND but UNVERIFIED. Full
> write-up + verification status: **API-NOTES §9**. Reference impl: **ArcUI** (installed, readable).

## Files
- `GloomsAuras.toc` — Interface 120007; load order: `Libs\*` → Core → Displays → CDM →
  `Media\TextureManifest.lua` → Config.
- `Core.lua` — namespace `GA` (`_G.GloomsAuras`), SavedVariables `GloomsAurasDB`, `/ga` router,
  **design tokens** `GA.COLOR / GA.FONT / GA.MEDIA` (matched to Build Barn).
- `Displays.lua` — `GA.Displays`: on-screen frames (texture/size/pos/alpha + tint/desaturate/blend/
  strata), **glow** (`ApplyGlow` via LibCustomGlow, OnShow/OnHide-driven), drag-to-move while panel open
  (NOT clamped), Cooldown swipe (OOC), **`RefreshForced`** (editor preview = selected + eye-on only).
- `CDM.lua` — `GA.CDM`: the mirror engine — state tracking, **recursive grouped trigger eval** (AND/OR/
  NONE), discovery, hooks.
- `Config.lua` — `GA.Config`: the whole GUI toolkit (`flatButton/flatCheck/flatEditBox/MakeSlider/
  MakeColor/MakeCycle/makeSwitch/MakeDropdown/skinPlate/addEdges`) + two-pane panel + aura picker +
  **texture picker** + **grouped trigger tree editor** (`C._trig`) + visibility/sound/text/**glow**/profile
  drawers. Much drawer/editor state hangs on the `C` table (chunk-local cap).
- `Media/TextureManifest.lua` — auto-generated `GA.TextureShapes` (254 aura shapes). Regenerate via
  `scratchpad/gen_manifest.py` if the bundled art changes.
- `Media/` — bundled Khand/GeneralSans fonts, `bg_flame.png`, `minimap.png`, Jason's custom UI icons
  (`lock_locked/unlocked.png`, `triangle.png` = collapse caret, `settings.png` = group gear,
  `hidden/unhidden.png` = per-aura eye), `Textures/` (107 shape files) + `PowerAurasMedia/Auras/`
  (145 curls) — copied from ThisWeeksAuras.
- `MinimapButton.lua` — `GA:InitMinimapButton` / `GA:ToggleMinimapButton` (LibDBIcon launcher).
- `Libs/` — embedded LibStub, CallbackHandler-1.0, LibDataBroker-1.1, LibDBIcon-1.0,
  LibSharedMedia-3.0, **LibCustomGlow-1.0** (aura glow effects) — source: TWA's copies. `Libs/` is
  gitignored (packager fetches all libs at release); the local working copy keeps them.

## What's BUILT + QA status
- ✅ **QA'd** Buff mirror — Trick Shots texture shows while buff active (in combat).
- ✅ **QA'd** Options panel — texture path, width/height, X/Y, alpha; each control = slider +
  −/+ steppers + numeric box; movable window; remembers position.
- ✅ **QA'd** Aura picker — "Browse auras" scroll list of the CDM registry (icon+name), click to add.
- ✅ **QA'd** Drag-to-position auras (while panel open), synced with the X/Y numbers.
- ✅ **QA'd** Cooldown availability mirror for **non-charge** cooldowns (Rapid Fire) — shows when
  ready, hides on cooldown, in combat.
- ✅ **QA'd** Conditions/Trigger system — per-display trigger: conditions on any spells, combined
  AND/OR; Trigger editor UI (Edit Trigger… button → editor window). Full sweep passed 2026-07-07:
  all four leaf types (buff_active, buff_inactive, cd_ready, cd_oncd) + both AND and OR logic, in
  combat. Data structured so it can grow to nested/mixed groups later.
- ✅ **QA'd** Panel restyle (2026-07-07) — two-pane layout: LEFT = scrollable list of created
  displays (replaces the old `< prev / next >` scrubber), RIGHT = the settings editor. Skinned
  to match GloomsBuildBarn (navy plate, purple accents, bundled Khand/GeneralSans fonts in
  `Media/`, flat buttons). Picker + trigger-editor windows reskinned to match.
- ✅ **QA'd** Display render options (2026-07-07) — Tint (opens ColorPickerFrame), Desaturate,
  Blend Mode (Blend/Add/Modulate/Alpha Key/Opaque), Frame Strata. All pure rendering.
- ✅ **QA'd** Texture picker (2026-07-07) — "Choose…" button → window with a category dropdown +
  search + scrollable grid + live preview swatch. Categories: **254 bundled aura shapes** (Shapes,
  PowerAuras Heads-Up/Icons/Separated/Words, Beams, Sparks, Runes), **Game Icons** (all game icons
  via `GetMacroIcons`/`GetLooseMacroIcons`), **StoneTweaks Graphics** (read from `StoneTweaksDB`,
  by path), **Shared Media (bars)** (LibSharedMedia — bar textures only).
- ✅ **QA'd** Flat input styling (no `InputBoxTemplate`), size cap raised **512 → 8192**, display
  frames **un-clamped** so auras can sit partially/fully off-screen. X/Y offset **slider** range is
  **±2000** (narrowed from ±4000 on 2026-07-07 — ±4000 made the slider too coarse; drag-to-move and
  `/ga pos` stay un-clamped for bigger moves).
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07** — **Custom flat sliders** (dropped `OptionsSliderTemplate` for a
  plain Slider: dark track = input-field fill, no border, bright-purple vertical marker thumb) +
  **aspect-ratio lock** on Width/Height (thin 1px purple bracket in the right margin joining the two
  boxes; when engaged, scaling one scales the other by `cfg.aspect`, the w/h ratio captured at lock
  time). Lock icon = Jason's custom 24×24 PNGs `Media/lock_locked.png` / `Media/lock_unlocked.png`
  (colors baked in → shown **untinted**, `SetVertexColor(1,1,1,1)`; state = which texture, not tint).
  **Texture facts (verified this client):** PNG loads fine AND non-power-of-two is fine — `Media/
  bg_flame.png` is 5000×4107 and renders. SVG unsupported.
- ✅ **Panel tweaks (QA'd 2026-07-07)** — **Remove** button moved from the editor pane to the
  LEFT pane; all button labels to **Title Case**. Left pane now stacks **Add / Duplicate / Remove**
  (`LIST_ROWS` → 17).
- ✅ **Duplicate Aura (QA'd 2026-07-07, REGRESSION-SENSITIVE)** — "Duplicate Aura" button makes
  an exact copy of the selected aura, INCLUDING on the same spell. Required re-keying `db.displays`
  from spellID → display id (see data-model note above); done backward-compatibly (originals keep
  their spellID key + `cfg.spellID`, so existing auras behave identically). Copy is deep-copied
  (independent trigger/visibility/sound), labelled "… (copy)", nudged +24/−24 so it doesn't overlap.
  **Restore point before this work: commit `248a9a7`** (`git reset --hard 248a9a7` to undo). QA order:
  FIRST confirm existing auras still show/hide + render exactly as before, THEN test Duplicate.
  - **Drag = selected only (2026-07-07):** with the panel open, only the aura selected in the left
    list is mouse-draggable on screen (others are visible but click-through) — so overlapping
    duplicates don't fight for the cursor. `D.selectedID` + `D:ApplyInteractivity`; Config sets it in
    `SetSelected` and clears it on panel close (nil ⇒ `/ga preview` back-door still drags all).
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07 — Docked side-panel (drawer)** — the Trigger/Visibility/Sound/Texture editors
  attach flush to the main panel's RIGHT edge (parented to it → follows on drag, closes with it),
  flipping LEFT if they'd run off-screen. One at a time (`CloseSubWindows`/`DockRight`). Drag disabled
  when docked (`SetMovable(false)` + `if f:IsMovable()` guards on each titlebar). The aura picker stays
  floating (it can overlay the Trigger editor when adding a condition).
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07 — UI cleanup batch** — borderless text inputs (focus brightens the fill);
  lighter button font (GeneralSans-Medium); **Blend + Strata are dropdown menus** (`MakeDropdown`),
  Blend trimmed to Blend/Add(glow)/Modulate; "Choose…" inline with the path field (no preview swatch);
  Game-Icons texture search is a **"Spell ID"** lookup (icons are nameless fileIDs); Title Case labels;
  X/Y offset slider ±2000; Trigger editor footer width-capped so it stops overrunning the frame.
- ✅ **QA'd** Per-display sound picker (2026-07-07) — "Sound" button → picker window (LibSharedMedia
  sounds + None, click-to-preview, draggable scrollbar) + a Test button. `cfg.sound = {file,name,
  channel}`; fires on hidden→shown via `CDM:PlaySound` (throttled). NOTE: **no per-sound volume** —
  `PlaySoundFile` takes only (file, channel); the only volume lever is WoW's global channel sliders.
- ✅ **QA'd** Minimap button (2026-07-07) — `MinimapButton.lua` via LibDBIcon/LibDataBroker (embedded),
  uses `Media/minimap.png` (Jason's 256×256 icon; also wired as `## IconTexture`). Left-click opens
  the panel; `/ga minimap` toggles; pos+hide saved in `db.minimap`. Self-contained fallback if libs absent.
- ✅ **QA'd** Visibility system (2026-07-07) — per-display player/game-state gate that **ANDs with the
  Trigger**. "Visibility…" editor: Combat/Target 3-way, toggles (casting, mounted, vehicle, instance,
  encounter, resting, stealthed, group, raid, warmode, alive), **Specialization** multi-select,
  **Spell/Talent known**. Engine = `CDM:VisibilityGate` + a 0.2s poll (`UpdateVisibilityPoll`) that
  runs only while some display uses visibility. All plain game APIs (no secret data). See learnings.
- ✅ **QA'd — Hide Blizzard's Cooldown Manager** (global toggle): checkbox in the panel's bottom strip +
  `/ga hidecdm`. Drives the four viewers' **alpha** only (0 = hidden), NEVER `Hide()` — because
  `CooldownViewerMixin:OnHide()` unregisters UNIT_AURA/SPELL_UPDATE_COOLDOWN (client source), so a real
  hide would silently break our mirror. `IsShown()` stays true → tracking keeps running. Suspended while
  Edit Mode is open (so the viewers stay visible/movable); re-asserts alpha-0 after Blizzard re-applies
  its own Opacity setting via a per-viewer `hooksecurefunc(v,"UpdateSystemSettingOpacity")`. Engine:
  `CDM:ApplyBlizzardHide` / `ToggleBlizzardHide` + `EditMode.Enter`/`Exit` callbacks. Global `db.hideBlizzardCDM`.
  - ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07**: `/ga hidecdm` hides the CDM icons AND tracking still fires (Rapid Fire aura
    confirmed working with the CDM invisible — proves alpha-0 keeps the mirror alive). Edit Mode
    round-trip confirmed: CDM reappears + movable while editing, re-hides on exit.
  - **LEARNING (Edit Mode = sample data):** entering Edit Mode makes the CDM display SAMPLE/preview
    state (all items look active) — our mirror faithfully reflected it, so auras flipped on + sounds
    fired. `RefreshDisplays`/`PlaySound` now bail while suppressed. **Subtle bug (fixed 2026-07-07):**
    the sound leaked on Edit Mode *EXIT*, not enter — `EditModeManagerFrame:ExitEditMode()` clears
    `editModeActive` on its FIRST line, THEN tears down the sample data, so those teardown transitions
    saw `EditModeActive()==false` and slipped a stray show/sound through. Fix: a `CDM._emSettling`
    window (set on `EditMode.Exit`, cleared after 0.4s) extends the freeze past exit, then a silent
    `Discover` re-syncs. ✅ QA'd — no sound on EM enter OR exit.
  - ✅ **QA'd**: the panel checkbox reflects/toggles state; persists across `/reload`.

- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07 — Groups Phase 1 (data + engine)** — auras can be bucketed into named
  **groups**, each carrying one **load rule** (a `visibility` table) + an **OFF/ON switch** that
  gate ALL the group's auras at once, ANDed **in front of** each aura's own visibility+trigger.
  Engine: `CDM:GroupGate(cfg)` (reuses `VisibilityGate` on `group.visibility` — zero new logic,
  no secret data) called first in `EvalDisplay`; `UpdateVisibilityPoll` also turns on for a live
  group rule. UI: new **GROUP** section in the aura editor — group dropdown (assign / "+ New
  Group…"), **Load Rule…** (opens the now group-aware Visibility editor via `OpenGroupVisibilityEditor`),
  an OFF/ON **switch** (`makeSwitch`, ported from GloomsBuildBarn — Jason prefers sliding switches
  over checkboxes for on/off), and **Delete Group** (members fall back to Ungrouped; auras never
  deleted). Group naming uses a **skinned** `OpenNameDialog` (NOT StaticPopup — see learning).
  Data at `GA.db.groups[gid]` + `db.groupSeq` (top level under schema 1; **Phase 3 migration must
  move them into the profile** — noted in the design doc). Panel grew (628→704h, LIST_ROWS 17→20)
  to fit the section. **Gating only applies with the panel CLOSED** (auras are force-shown while
  it's open — same as trigger/visibility), so QA it on a dummy in combat. QA passed: spec load-rule
  gates the whole set both ways; on/off switch hides/shows the set; create/delete/name all clean.
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07 — Groups Phase 2 (grouped left pane + Manage drawer)** — the LEFT pane now
  renders **group headers** (custom triangle caret `Media/triangle.png`, rotated 90° for expanded;
  a **settings gear** `Media/settings.png` on the right) with their auras nested beneath, then an
  **Ungrouped** section, then the Add/Duplicate/Remove stack. Clicking a header collapses/expands
  (`group.collapsed`; Ungrouped uses `db.ungroupedCollapsed`). The gear opens a docked **Manage
  Group drawer** (`OpenGroupManager`) — **Rename** (reuses `OpenNameDialog`), **Load Rule…**
  (`OpenGroupVisibilityEditor`), an OFF/ON **switch**, **Move Up/Down** (`MoveGroup`, normalizes
  `group.order` then swaps), **Delete Group** (`DeleteGroup` → members to Ungrouped). The aura
  editor's GROUP section shrank to just the **assign dropdown + hint** (group settings moved to the
  drawer). Render model = `BuildLeftPaneEntries()` (typed rows: group / aura / ungrouped) fed to a
  reused row pool in `RefreshList`. QA passed: collapse, gear→drawer, rename, load rule, on/off,
  reorder, delete all clean.
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07 — Per-aura eye toggle** (Jason-requested) — each aura row has an **eye icon**
  on its right (`Media/unhidden.png` = shown, `Media/hidden.png` = disabled) that toggles
  `cfg.enabled`. Disabling greys the row + hides the aura (via `CDM:Discover`, which excludes
  disabled auras from the watch set and hides their frames even while the panel forces others shown).
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07 — Aura rename** — the aura-name title at the top of the editor is a click-to-edit
  EditBox (faint fill + "click to rename" hint); Enter renames `cfg.label` (list name), independent of
  the tracked spell + the on-screen text. Left-pane list rows use `SetWordWrap(false)` so long names
  truncate on one line instead of wrapping.
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-07 — On-screen Text overlay** (the label under each aura, fully configurable) —
  `cfg.text = { show, str, font, size, outline, anchor, x, y, color }`. Opened via **Text…** on the
  editor's "Sound & Text" row → a docked **Text drawer**: Show OFF/ON, content box (blank = the aura's
  name — a SEPARATE field from the list name, Jason's choice), **Font** (a picker previewing bundled
  GeneralSans/Khand + LSM fonts in their own typeface), Size, **Outline** (None/Outline/Thick), Color
  (Tint), **Anchor** (Below/Above/On aura/Left/Right via `Displays.LABEL_ANCHOR`), X/Y offset. The
  on-screen label in `Displays:ApplyConfig` is now fully data-driven (bundled font + outline, NOT the
  old `GameFontNormal`); no `cfg.text` ⇒ legacy `showLabel` + name (backward-compatible). Drawer follows
  the panel selection (`C.RefreshTextEditor`, self-guards to when open so it doesn't seed `text` on every
  select). This closes the deferred "Text overlays + LSM font picker" item.
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-08 — Profiles (Groups+Profiles Phase 3), the whole feature.** Named, switchable configs
  with a per-character default (WeakAuras-style). Shipped in two committed sub-steps:
  - **3A — data foundation** (`fc41649`): schema 1→2 migration + a `GA.global` (account-wide) / `GA.db`
    (active profile) split. `GA.db` is REPOINTED to the active profile, so the ~40 existing
    `GA.db.displays`/`groups`/`seq` call sites are untouched (the `DB()`/`Groups()` accessors already
    indirect through `GA.db`). Migration runs at **PLAYER_LOGIN** (char name reliable then, NOT
    ADDON_LOADED): the old flat top-level keys (`displays/groups/seq/groupSeq/hideBlizzardCDM/
    ungroupedCollapsed`) MOVE into a profile named `"Name - Realm"` before being cleared. `panelPos` +
    `minimap` moved to `GA.global` (account-wide). QA'd: existing auras + the Marksmanship group survived.
  - **3B — switcher UI** (`6deae65`): a bottom-right **"Profile: ‹name›"** button opens a docked **Profiles
    drawer** — a click-to-switch profile list + **New / Copy Current / Rename / Delete** (Delete confirms via
    a small skinned `C:OpenConfirm`, and refuses to delete the only profile). Core API in `Core.lua`
    (`GA:SwitchProfile/CreateProfile/CopyProfile/RenameActiveProfile/DeleteProfile/ProfileNames/
    ActiveProfileName`); each repoints `GA.db` then `GA.RefreshForProfile` (hide the old profile's frames →
    `CDM:Discover` → `C:OnProfileSwitched` rebuilds the panel + re-shows the new set). `/ga profile [name]`
    back-door. QA sweep passed: create+switch both ways, delete+fallback+confirm, and **copy independence**
    (deep-copied — editing the copy left the original untouched). Deleting the ACTIVE profile falls back to
    the first remaining one; chars pointing at a deleted profile re-resolve to their own default next login.
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-08 — Slider thumbs recolored** purple → **orange `#FF7729`** (`COLOR.orange`) on the
  Alpha/Width/Height/X/Y sliders (Jason request). Scrollbar thumbs stay purple. `MakeSlider` only.
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-08 — Appearance-first aura creation + DECORATION auras** (`bcb1912`). Scope had
  outgrown "pick a spell first": **`+ Add Aura` now makes a BLANK aura** (placeholder `Circle_Smooth`
  graphic, name "New Aura", `showLabel=false`), selected in the editor — NO picker popup. **Spells enter
  ONLY via the Trigger** now (the picker still backs "Edit Trigger… → + Add Condition"; the "Track a
  Spell" shortcut Jason briefly considered was dropped as redundant with triggers). `cfg.spellID` is now
  **optional**. `EvalDisplay` has THREE cases after the Group+Visibility gates: (1) has a Trigger → trigger
  decides; (2) no trigger + has `spellID` → auto-show on that spell's state (**legacy back-compat, no
  migration**); (3) no trigger + no `spellID` → **pure decoration, always shown** (e.g. a graphic gated to
  out-of-combat via Visibility — Jason's "pink cat in the corner" case). Trigger summary now says which:
  "always shown (decoration)" vs "shows on its own spell's state". QA'd: blank create, decoration persists
  when panel closed, Visibility(Out-of-Combat) hides/shows it on a dummy. **The engine already watched
  trigger-condition spells (`WatchedSpells`) and already treated the Trigger as the sole source of truth
  when present — this change just made that the primary model + allowed no-spell auras.**
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-08 — Glow effects (LibCustomGlow)** (`fa12820`). New **"Effects"** section at the
  bottom of the editor with a **"Glow…"** button → docked **glow drawer**: Type (None / Autocast Shine /
  Pixel Glow / Proc Glow / Action Button Glow) + optional **Custom Color**. `cfg.glow = { type,
  customColor, color }`. Engine in `Displays.lua`: `StartGlow`/`StopGlow`/`ApplyGlow` (all **pcall-guarded**
  → a bad arg degrades to "no glow", never a Lua error); the glow follows the frame's shown state via
  **OnShow/OnHide hooks** (starts on show, stops on hide, no per-poll churn since those fire only on real
  transitions) and re-applies on any config change (`ApplyConfig` calls `ApplyGlow`). **Pure rendering, no
  aura data.** LibCustomGlow-1.0 embedded like our other libs (TOC loads it after LibStub; `.pkgmeta`
  fetches it — URL flagged to confirm before first release). Panel grew 704→740 / `PANE_H` 600→636 for the
  Effects row; `MakeColor` gained an optional label (reused as "Custom Color"); glow UI state on `C._glow`.
  **KNOWN + inherent:** the glow traces the aura's **frame rectangle** (bounding box), NOT the texture's
  alpha shape — so it looks best on square-ish icons and boxy on non-square/irregular art. Not fixable
  (LibCustomGlow limitation); crop-to-fit (Frame & Shaping roadmap) is the mitigation for non-square icons.
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-08 — One-level GROUPED trigger logic (AND/OR/NONE)** (`1294c8f`). A trigger condition
  can now be a **group** (`{logic, conditions={leaf,…}}`) alongside leaves, so `(X OR Y) AND Z` etc. are
  expressible. `EvalTrigger` recurses + supports **NONE** (NOR = NOT any, group-level negation);
  `WatchedSpells` recurses (`CollectCondSpells`) so group-nested spells get mirrored. Backward-compatible
  (flat triggers = a top group of leaves). Editor rewritten as a scrolling tree: top logic + leaf rows +
  group headers (own AND/OR/NONE) + indented conditions + a purple **"+ Add to group" text link** +
  "+ Add Condition" / "+ Add Group". State on `C._trig`. **Per-condition NOT** already exists via the
  inverse states (Buff Inactive / CD On Cooldown). **⚠ Flat triggers verified in combat (auras show); a
  trigger with an actual GROUP has NOT been end-to-end QA'd in combat yet — do that next session.**
- ✅ **QA'd 2026-07-08 — Eye = editor preview + Disabled toggle** (`3e5d34a`). The eye icon was RE-scoped
  (Jason clarified it never meant enable/disable): it now = **"show THIS aura on screen while the panel is
  open"** (`cfg.preview`, default off), purely an editor convenience. While the panel is open the preview
  shows only the **selected aura + eye-on auras** (`Displays:RefreshForced`) instead of all at once — fixes
  the "every aura visible while editing" clutter. In-game (panel closed) is unchanged. **Enable/disable**
  moved to a **"Disabled | Enabled" switch** at the bottom of the Visibility editor — drives `cfg.enabled`
  for an aura, or `group.enabled` in a group's **Load Rule** (both places). Greys the list row when off.
  A one-time **v2 migration** (`prof._eyeFixed=2`) re-enables every aura to recover from (a) the old eye
  mis-setting `enabled=false` and (b) an interim switch's Lua-idiom bug (see LEARNINGS).

## Hard-won LEARNINGS (verified — do NOT rediscover)
- **The `a and b or c` idiom BREAKS when `b` is `nil`/`false` — never use it to assign nil.** A "Disabled"
  switch set `cfg.enabled = v and nil or false`: for `v==true` that's `(true and nil)`→nil→`(nil or false)`→
  **false**, so it evaluated `false` in BOTH directions — could disable an aura but never re-enable it, which
  looked like "auras don't show in combat" (they were stranded off). Use an explicit `if v then x=nil else
  x=false end`. Lesson: for any assignment whose "true" value is `nil` or `false`, write the `if`, not the
  ternary. (2026-07-08; also mirrored a symptom into a scary-looking display bug — always suspect data state
  before the render path.)
- **`FontString:SetShadowColor` / `SetShadowOffset` render NOTHING in this client** — a drop shadow via
  the shadow API is invisible at any offset. We dropped the shadow option (outline flags are the text
  styling). If a shadow is ever truly needed, draw it manually (a black text copy offset behind), but
  even a behind-sublevel copy layered awkwardly — not worth it; outline suffices.
- **Lua 5.1 caps a function at 60 UPVALUES (`local`s captured from enclosing scope).** `Config.lua`'s
  giant `Build()` hit exactly 60 after Phase 1; one more (a `DEFAULT_FONT` ref) → `function ... has
  more than 60 upvalues` at LOAD time and the panel wouldn't open. luac 5.5's `-p` does NOT enforce the
  60 cap, **but `luac -l -l Config.lua` prints each function's `N upvalues` count** — subtract 1 for
  `_ENV` (5.5 has it, 5.1 doesn't) to get the 5.1 number. Build's prototype count = every module-scope
  `local` referenced by Build OR any closure nested in it. Fix pattern: extract chunks of `Build` into
  their own module-level functions (`BuildGroupSection`, `BuildGroupManager`) so each gets its own 60
  budget — OR hang new state/helpers on the `C` table (a field access, not an upvalue). **Build sits at
  57 (Lua 5.1) after Phase 3; keep it there.**
- **Lua caps a function at 200 LOCALS too — and the file CHUNK (top-level) counts (hit 2026-07-08).**
  Every module-scope `local` (constants, `local function` helpers, forward-decls) counts toward the main
  chunk's 200. Phase-3B's first draft added ~11 module locals and overflowed: `luac -p` → `too many
  local variables (limit is 200) in main function`. **Unlike the 60-upvalue cap, luac 5.5's `-p` DOES
  catch this** (same limit). `Config.lua`'s chunk is at **198/200** — essentially full. Fix pattern used:
  put ALL new profile state + UI functions on the **`C` table** (`C._prof`, `function C:OpenProfileManager`…)
  instead of module locals → zero new chunk locals. Do the same for any future Config.lua feature.
- **Game fonts lack the ▼/▶ unicode triangles → they render as a tofu box.** Don't use unicode
  glyphs (or native Blizzard textures — Jason's rule) for UI marks. Use Jason's bundled PNG icons in
  `Media/` shown untinted (`SetVertexColor(1,1,1,1)`): `triangle.png` (collapse caret, rotated via
  `Texture:SetRotation` — right=collapsed, -pi/2=down=expanded), `settings.png` (gear), `hidden/
  unhidden.png` (eye), `lock_locked/unlocked.png`. Ask Jason to make an icon rather than reaching for
  a glyph or Blizzard art.
- **StaticPopup edit box is `dialog.EditBox` (PascalCase) in Midnight, NOT `dialog.editBox`** — the
  lowercase alias is GONE (GameDialog.xml system), so `OnShow`/`OnAccept` referencing `self.editBox`
  throw `attempt to index field 'editBox' (a nil value)`. We sidestepped StaticPopup entirely with a
  small **skinned** `OpenNameDialog` (flatEditBox + OK/Cancel) — nicer chrome AND no client-field
  fragility. If StaticPopup is ever needed, use `dialog.EditBox or dialog.editBox`.
- **1-charge spells are NORMAL cooldowns, not the "unreadable charge" wall (fixed 2026-07-07):**
  `cooldownInfo.charges` just means "uses the charge system". What matters is **maxCharges**:
  **1 ⇒ track like any cooldown** (Kill Shot, most executes); **≥2 ⇒ genuinely unreadable in combat**
  (Aimed Shot). We were bucketing *any* charge flag as unreadable, so a 1-charge cd's availability
  stayed `nil` forever and never wired into the cooldown-widget hook path → `cd_ready` was stuck.
  Fix: read `GetSpellCharges().maxCharges` (readable OOC), cache it in `CDM.maxCharges` (persists
  across Discover), classify `isCharge = maxCharges>=2`. **This also transparently handles spell
  OVERRIDES** (Black Arrow replacing Kill Shot via a hero talent): the CDM item's cooldown widget
  reflects the override, and we match the item by base spellID (`InfoMatchesSpell` checks
  spellID/override/linked), so tracking Kill Shot mirrors Black Arrow with no override-specific code.
- **`item.isOnActualCooldown` is SECRET in combat when off-GCD (verified via /ga trace 2026-07-07):**
  it's `not isOnGCD and cooldownIsActive`; on the GCD it short-circuits to a plain `false`, but OFF
  the GCD it evaluates `cooldownIsActive` (a secret in combat) → returns SECRET *exactly when the real
  cooldown matters*. So it is NOT a combat availability source (unlike `item:IsActive()` for buffs).
  `CDM:SyncCooldowns` uses it only as an OUT-OF-COMBAT accuracy pass; **in-combat availability comes
  from the `CooldownFrame_Set/Clear` widget hooks.** TRADE-OFF still stands: right after casting the
  tracked cd spell, during its ~1.5s GCD the hook skips (isOnGCD) so it briefly reads "available".
- **Blank labels on the FIRST login of a session (2026-07-07):** WoW sometimes hasn't finished
  loading a bundled runtime TTF when the panel is built on an early `/ga`, so *some* labels render
  BLANK (button backgrounds fine, glyphs missing) until a `/reload` caches the font. `setFont`'s
  fallback only catches an *invalid* path, not "valid path, glyphs not ready yet". Fix: `GA.PreloadFonts`
  in Core.lua draws+measures a throwaway string in each `GA.FONT` face at `PLAYER_LOGIN`, warming the
  cache before any panel builds. Only reproduces on a true fresh login (a `/reload` already has the
  fonts cached), so verify by logging out to char-select and back in, then opening `/ga` immediately.
- The frame method is **`StopMovingOrSizing`**, NOT `StopMovingAndSizing` (nonexistent). The
  typo made every drag "stick to the cursor." Cross-check method names against GloomsBuildBarn.
- **Create frames HIDDEN** (`f:Hide()` at end of build) so the first `:Show()` actually
  transitions and fires `OnShow` — otherwise "have to open it twice to populate" bugs.
- `Button:SetScript("OnClick", fn)` calls `fn(button, ...)` — passing a bare function whose
  first param means something else gets the button as that arg (caused the OpenPicker crash).
  Wrap: `function() fn() end`.
- **Buff active-state**: `item:IsActive()` is a **plain bool in open-world combat** (confirmed).
  Mirror via `hooksecurefunc(itemFrame, "OnActiveStateChanged", …)`.
- **Non-charge cooldown availability WORKS**: hook globals `CooldownFrame_Set`/`CooldownFrame_Clear`
  filtered to `item:GetCooldownFrame()`, plus `item:OnCooldownDone`. Seed initial state OOC via
  `GetSpellCooldown`. Never reads a secret.
- **DoTs / target debuffs — the `IsActive()` mirror is NOT enough (VERIFIED 2026-07-08, Warlock, 8
  captures):** the Tracked-Bar `IsActive()` reads correctly when POLLED, but (1) nothing re-polls it on
  a target SWAP (no `OnActiveStateChanged` fires) → it goes stale on screen, and (2) a spell enrolled in
  TWO viewers (Haunt in Essential `cat=0` + BuffBar `cat=3`) makes `Discover` map both frames to one
  spellID → they fight over the shared `buffActive/available[]` var = the "goes random" symptom. The
  proven fix: read `frame.auraInstanceID` + `C_UnitAuras` on the `selfAura` unit, re-eval on
  `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED`, and disambiguate matching by cooldownID. **Proven correct across 8 target-swap
  captures; NOT yet built or QA'd. UNVERIFIED in instance/M+/raid.** Detail: API-NOTES §9.
- **Trigger `nil`-availability default (fixed 2026-07-07):** an idle-available cooldown never fires
  a transition and is secret in combat, so `available[sid]` stays **nil**. `EvalDisplay` (auto,
  no-trigger) already defaulted nil→ready, but `EvalCondition` (cd_ready as a trigger condition)
  defaulted nil→NOT-ready — same value, opposite meaning. Compound "RF cd_ready AND …" silently
  failed. Fix: `cd_ready` now defaults nil→READY **for non-charge only** (charge stays nil→not-ready,
  since charges are genuinely unreadable). Lesson: the two eval paths must agree on unknown-state.
- **GCD false-positive on `CooldownFrame_Set` (fixed 2026-07-07):** every cast triggers the global
  cooldown, and the CDM re-runs `CooldownFrame_Set` on each item's widget to redraw — even for a
  spell NOT on its own cd. The hook was marking it unavailable, sticking it "on cooldown" until a
  real off-cd transition (this is why casting Aimed Shot/Multi-Shot broke Rapid Fire's condition).
  Fix: the Set hook now **skips while `item.isOnGCD == true`** (plain bool, guarded), keyed via a
  new `cdFrameToItem` map. Also reseed availability on `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`. TRADE-OFF: casting
  the tracked cd spell *itself* now leaves its aura lit ~1.5s (the GCD) before it flips to on-cd.
- **`/ga trace`** (new): focused per-display dump — shown?, our `buffActive`/`available` mirror,
  the item's cached `isOnGCD`/`isOnActualCooldown`/`cooldownIsActive`, and each trigger condition's
  evaluated result. Ask Jason to run it IN the failing state — it makes trigger bugs a 30-sec find.
- **WALLS (confirmed from client docs — cannot out-code):**
  - **Cooldown timers in combat**: every `SetCooldown*` is `AllowedWhenUntainted` → an addon
    can't feed a secret duration to a timer widget. Works out of combat only.
  - **Charge-spell availability**: `GetSpellCharges` AND `GetSpellCastCount` are both
    `SecretWhenCooldownsRestricted`; `IsSpellUsable` ignores cooldown AND charges (always true).
    So directly READING "do I have a charge" is unknowable in combat. **✅ BUT (2026-07-08) the DOOR is
    CONFIRMED — the "shadow cooldown" technique: route a duration OBJECT through a hidden Cooldown widget
    and read its `IsShown()` to DERIVE availability without reading the count. VERIFIED on Aimed Shot
    (2→1→0→1→2): `mainShown==false` ⇔ ≥1 charge castable; the object feed does NOT throw in combat. This
    RETIRES the wall for AVAILABILITY (gives "≥1", not exact count). Details: API-NOTES §9.3. NOT yet
    built into the addon.**
  - Only partial charge signal: `C_SpellActivationOverlay` detects **procs** — but procs that
    grant a buff (e.g. Lock and Load) are already trackable as a **buff-active** condition, so
    that path is redundant.
- **Placement requirement**: a spell must be placed on a CDM viewer (Edit Mode → Cooldown
  Manager), not merely in the registry, to be tracked. `/ga charges` reports charge status;
  `/ga debug` shows FOUND/NOT FOUND + state.

## Diagnostics / commands
- `/ga` — open the options panel. `/ga help` — list commands.
- `/ga debug` — CDM state dump (availability/kind/charge/IsSpellUsable per display). Ask Jason
  to paste this (or BugSack) when diagnosing.
- `/ga profile [name]` — list profiles (active marked), or switch to one. Panel is primary.
- `/ga minimap` — show/hide the minimap button (persisted).
- `/ga hidecdm` — hide/show Blizzard's Cooldown Manager (alpha-0, tracking stays live; persisted).
- `/ga charges` — which cooldowns support availability tracking (charge spells flagged). Run OOC.
- `/ga trace` — per-display trigger diagnostic (shown?, buffActive/available mirror, item cooldown
  fields, each condition's eval). Run IN the failing state; makes trigger bugs a 30-sec find.
- `/ga probe [filter]` — EXHAUSTIVE read-only secret-safe-signals dump (per CDM item: `selfAura`,
  `auraInstanceID` present?, `C_UnitAuras` player/target presence + duration, which hook methods the
  frame exposes, shadow-cooldown readiness). **Writes each capture to the SavedVariables file**
  (`WTF/Account/AELWYN/SavedVariables/GloomsAuras.lua` → `GloomsAurasDB.probeLog`, last 40) so Claude
  reads it straight off disk after a `/reload` — no transcription, and captures can be taken at exact
  states. `/ga probe clear` wipes the log.
- `/ga capture` — a movable **CAPTURE button**: click it at each game state (mid-combat, right after a
  target swap) to fire a probe without typing. Built for the §9 investigation.
- `/ga add|remove|list|pos|size|preview|test` — legacy/back-door commands (panel is primary).

## SavedVariables data model  (schema 2 — profiles, since 2026-07-08)
> **Two layers (Phase 3).** `GA.global` = the raw SV `GloomsAurasDB`; `GA.db` = the ACTIVE PROFILE
> `GloomsAurasDB.profiles[activeName]`, REPOINTED on a switch. So `GA.db.displays/groups/seq/groupSeq/
> hideBlizzardCDM/ungroupedCollapsed` all read the active profile; only `panelPos` + `minimap` live on
> `GA.global` (account-wide). Active profile resolved at **PLAYER_LOGIN** (`GA.SetupActiveProfile`), which
> also runs the one-time schema 1→2 migration. Profile ops are `GA:SwitchProfile/Create/Copy/
> RenameActive/Delete/ProfileNames/ActiveProfileName` in `Core.lua`.
```
GloomsAurasDB = {                                     -- = GA.global (account-wide)
  schema = 2,

```
> **Keying (unchanged from 2026-07-07 Duplicate work):** each profile's `displays` key is an opaque
> **display id**, NOT

> `frameToSpell` values, and all `C_Spell.*` calls = **cfg.spellID**. `DisplayList()` sorts by

id counter) + `GA.db.ungroupedCollapsed` (bool) — all now PER-PROFILE (moved off the top level in the
schema-2 migration). A grouped aura shows only when its **group is on AND the group's load rule passes**
— ANDed in front of the aura's own Visibility + Trigger.
`GA.db.hideBlizzardCDM = true/nil` (PER-PROFILE; hides the four Blizzard CDM viewers via alpha-0).
`GA.global.minimap = { hide, minimapPos }` (LibDBIcon, account-wide). Display shows when its **Trigger**

(Disabled) aura never shows/tracks. **Editor preview:** while the panel is open, `Displays:RefreshForced`
shows ONLY the selected aura + `preview`-on (eye) auras — NOT all of them (was "all enabled" before 2026-07-08).
`state` ∈ `buff_active | buff_inactive | cd_ready | cd_oncd`. **No trigger** (after Group+Visibility pass):
if `cfg.spellID` set ⇒ auto-behavior (its own spell: buff→active, cooldown→available); if NO `spellID` ⇒
**decoration, always shown**. New auras (`+ Add Aura`) are blank/decoration; spells are added via the
Trigger only. Width/Height range 8–8192, offset slider ±2000 (drag/`/ga pos` un-clamped).
`GA.global.panelPos` stores the panel location (account-wide); `GA.global.schema = 2`. (The old
top-level `displays/groups/seq/groupSeq/hideBlizzardCDM/ungroupedCollapsed/media` keys are removed by the
migration.)

## Texture picker sourcing (verified 2026-07-07 — do NOT relitigate)
- **Game icons** are enumerable from the client: `GetMacroIcons`/`GetLooseMacroIcons`(+Item variants)
  fill a table with fileIDs + loose `Interface\ICONS\<name>` strings (Blizzard's own IconDataProvider
  pattern). No names to search by → browse-only.
- **The pretty aura shapes are NOT game files** — they're bundled inside WeakAuras/PowerAuras/TWA.
  We bundled them (copied TWA's `Media/Textures` + `PowerAurasMedia/Auras`, generated the manifest
  from TWA's `Private.texture_types`, rewrote paths TWA→GloomsAuras). No-extension `.tga` paths
  render fine in this client (mirrors TWA's working setup verbatim).
- **LibSharedMedia only carries bar/border/background textures**, not aura shapes — so its category
  is bar textures. StoneTweaks registers its *Textures* there as `statusbar`.
- **StoneTweaks Graphics** (the useful custom art) are NOT in LSM; they're files listed in
  `StoneTweaksDB.graphics` = array of `{name,file}`, path `Interface\AddOns\StoneTweaks\Graphics\<file>`.
  We read that table live at picker-open (reading another addon's SavedVariables global is fine).

## NEXT / pending

### ▶ ACTIVE THREAD (2026-07-08) — secret-safe DoT tracking (Jason's Affliction Warlock)
**DoT approach VERIFIED (API-NOTES §9). Step 1 SHIPPED + QA'd — and it fixed the target-swap for FREE.**
Root-cause bugs (§9.2) were (1) no re-eval on target change and (2) spellID-only matching COLLIDING when a
spell sits in two viewers (Haunt = Essential `cat=0` + BuffBar `cat=3`). **Jason wants to test EVERYTHING —
one step per QA pass; never declare done before he confirms in-game.**

- **Step 1 (frameKind disambiguation) — DONE + COMMITTED, QA'd on Warlock AND Hunter.** Route state by a
  per-FRAME role (`CDM.frameKind`) so a spell's cooldown entry can't clobber its aura entry's `buffActive`
  (and vice-versa); aura wins for the per-spell `kind` (auto path). Fixed the "goes random" flicker.
  **SURPRISE (verified): it ALSO fixed the target-swap** — once the cooldown entry stopped stomping it, the
  BAR entry's own `OnActiveStateChanged` (fires when the DoT leaves the current target) drives hide/show
  correctly. So the planned "Step 2" (`PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` + `auraInstanceID`) turned out **UNNECESSARY
  for correctness**. QA'd on Warlock: aura follows current target — shows on the DoTted dummy, hides on a
  clean one, returns on swap-back, hides on expiry; no errors, no flicker.
- **KNOWN ISSUE (minor; Jason deferred it) — reappear LAG.** Swapping BACK to a DoTted target occasionally
  lags ~0.5s before the aura returns (sometimes instant). Root cause = the CDM's target re-scan latency (it
  only knows the DoT is on the new target after its `UNIT_AURA`-driven rescan; we update exactly then).
  Re-polling the CDM's own state CAN'T beat this (its flag flips + fires its event simultaneously). The ONLY
  lever = scan the target OURSELVES on `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` via `C_UnitAuras` (by spellID), independent of
  the CDM — UNVERIFIED (secret-safety in combat) → needs a probe first. Not worth derailing; revisit later.
  (ArcUI has the same constraint; its "High Frequency Updates" toggle is its mitigation.)
- **PENDING QA (in order):**
  1. **Hunter regression — ✅ PASSED (2026-07-08).** Existing auras behave unchanged (Rapid Fire cd, Trick
     Shots buff, "Precise Shots active AND Kill Shot cd_ready" combo all clean). Step 1 committed.
  2. **Multi-target DoT** — Haunt is 1-target; test a multi-target DoT (Agony on 2–3 dummies, swap among
     them). Expected fine (the CDM tracks the debuff on the CURRENT TARGET, instance-agnostic via `IsActive`),
     but UNTESTED. NOTE the semantic: we track "is it on my CURRENT target," NOT "on any enemy" or stack count.
  3. **⏳ Instance / M+ / raid** — stricter secrecy; `IsActive`/`auraInstanceID` may go SECRET. Biggest
     unknown. Do NOT call the DoT feature "done" until tested in stricter content.
- **Charge "shadow cooldown" (Aimed Shot) — ✅ BUILT + QA'd + committed (Hunter, 2026-07-08).**
  `CDM.chargeShadow[sid]` = a hidden `Cooldown` fed the GCD-stripped `GetSpellCooldownDuration`; its
  `OnShow → available=false` / `OnHide → available=true` fire exactly at the 0↔1-charge boundary; re-fed on
  `SPELL_UPDATE_COOLDOWN` + `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`; seeded from `IsShown()` at Discover (`FeedChargeShadow`
  `seed=true`). Flows into the existing `cd_ready` machinery — **no new trigger types.** QA'd flawless over a
  couple minutes incl. natural regens, **procs, and shortened cooldowns**. Isolated to the `if charge` branch,
  so DoT / non-charge paths are structurally untouched. API-NOTES §9.3. **LIMIT: "≥1 available", not exact
  count** (that's the next revisit — see pending; 2-charge spells CAN get exact count via the charge shadow).
- **Optional payoff:** a real **duration countdown** on auras (`GetAuraDuration` → duration object → bar).
- **Tooling:** `/ga probe [filter]` + `/ga capture`; captures land in `probeLog` (read off disk). Don't
  delete/rewrite the probe code until this thread closes.

### Groups + Profiles — ALL THREE PHASES DONE ✅ (spec: [docs/GROUPS-PROFILES-DESIGN.md](GROUPS-PROFILES-DESIGN.md))
- **Phase 1 — Groups data + engine.** ✅ **DONE + QA'd 2026-07-07** (see BUILT list). Committed.
- **Phase 2 — Grouped left pane + Manage drawer.** ✅ **DONE + QA'd 2026-07-07** (see BUILT list).
- **Phase 3 — Profiles.** ✅ **DONE + QA'd 2026-07-08** (see BUILT list): schema-2 migration + `GA.global`/
  `GA.db` split (`fc41649`), switcher UI (`6deae65`). Feature complete; nothing left open here.

### ▶▶ START HERE NEXT SESSION — Effects work is IN PROGRESS
Jason kicked off an **effects/appearance** push (2026-07-08). Glow ✅ + grouped triggers ✅ + eye-preview /
Disabled ✅ shipped. Remaining:
0. **⚠ QA a GROUPED trigger IN COMBAT first.** The AND/OR/NONE engine is committed and the editor + flat
   triggers are verified, but a trigger containing an actual GROUP was never driven end-to-end in combat
   (build `(X OR Y) AND Z` on a dummy, confirm it gates correctly; also test a **NONE** group = NOT).
1. **Motion** — animate auras via native WoW **AnimationGroups** (pure rendering, no lib, no secret data):
   presets Pulse (scale) / Spin (rotation) / Bounce/Drift (translate) / Fade (alpha) / Orbit, each with
   speed + amount, plus a one-shot "pop/flash on show". Build as a **"Motion…"** button on the existing
   **Effects** row → its own docked drawer (mirror the glow drawer). Start/stop the AnimationGroup on the
   frame's OnShow/OnHide (same hook points glow uses).
2. **Frame & Shaping** — colored **border** (TWA "Add Border"; we bundle ring/border textures) + **crop-to-fit
   / zoom** for non-square icons (`SetTexCoord` to crop instead of stretch — ALSO the mitigation for the
   boxy-glow-on-non-square-art issue) + **rounded-corner presets** via `MaskTexture` (Square/Rounded/More/
   Circle — radius is baked into the mask, NOT a free px slider; verify masks work in Midnight first).
- **Dynamic group layout** — backburnered (Jason's call: "can of worms").
- Then **Export/import strings** (a `PROFILE` or single aura is one serializable table now).
- Watch the two Config.lua limits (60 upvalues on `Build` = 56 now; 200 chunk locals = **187 now** after
  moving trigger state to `C._trig` — see LEARNINGS): put new drawer state/functions on the `C` table,
  controls as Build-locals.

### Exact charge COUNT (Jason-requested revisit, after charge-availability build)
The shadow build gives "≥1 available." Getting the EXACT count is PARTLY possible, secret-safely:
- **2-charge spells (Aimed Shot):** the TWO shadows already distinguish all three states — 2=`main F,charge F`;
  1=`main F,charge T`; 0=`main T,charge T`. So exact count (0/1/2) is DERIVABLE for free from what we build.
- **3+ charge spells:** middle counts COLLAPSE (1 and 2 both read `main F, charge T` = "available, recharging"),
  so exact count is NOT derivable — best is full / partial / empty buckets. (`GetSpellCharges().currentCharges`
  and `GetSpellCastCount` are both SECRET in combat — confirmed in probe — so no direct read.)
Revisit: expose a charge-count signal (works fully for 2-charge, degrades to buckets for 3+). Explore
`C_Secrets` predicates only if buckets aren't enough (they return SECRET booleans → need a widget sink).

### Trigger-chooser UX (Jason-requested 2026-07-08, AFTER Aimed Shot)
The condition/aura picker (`BuildAuraList` in Config.lua) lists CDM items with confusing semantics:
1. **Debuffs are labelled "buff."** Haunt/Agony are `selfAura=false` (debuffs ON the target) but show
   under the "Buff" category tag. We now READ `selfAura` (see §9) — use it to label buff vs **debuff**
   (target) in the picker + the trigger condition rows, and probably reword the states ("debuff is
   active" for a target aura).
2. **Many spells appear TWICE** — once as a cooldown (Essential/Utility) and once as an aura (Buff/Bar),
   both spellID-identical. Confusing. Options to explore: merge the two into one picker entry that lets
   you choose "track its cooldown" vs "track its aura," or clearly tag each (e.g. "Haunt (cooldown)" vs
   "Haunt (debuff)"). Ties into the state defaulting in `TrigAddLeaf` (already uses kind → buff/cd).

### Other pending / deferred
- **Override display polish (optional, offered, Jason didn't decide):** show a spell's **override** name+
  icon in the picker/list when `info.overrideSpellID ~= spellID` (e.g. "Black Arrow" not "Kill Shot"),
  storing the **base** spellID for stable matching. Cosmetic — tracking already follows overrides.
- **Deferred texture transforms** — Mirror, Rotation, Texture Wrap (SetRotation interacts with SetTexCoord).
- **Visibility Phase 2** — rarer load conditions (Race/Faction/Level, Zone/Instance/difficulty, M+ affix,
  Equipment, Spec Role, PvP talent). Dropped Skyriding (no reliable "am I skyriding now" API).
- ~~Text overlays + LSM font picker~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 (see BUILT list — on-screen Text overlay).
- **Export/import** strings for sharing (later; naturally follows Profiles).

## Current in-game context
- **Jason's MAIN this season is Affliction Warlock** (added 2026-07-08) — char **"Gloomvale - Stormrage"**,
  account `AELWYN`. His CDM **Tracked Bars** hold Haunt (48181), Corruption (146739), Agony (980), Unstable
  Affliction (1259790), Seed of Corruption (27243) + the Curses; **Tracked Buffs** incl. Nightfall (264571);
  Burning Rush (111400, a self-buff that sits in BuffBar → `selfAura=true`). He also runs **ArcUI**, which
  tracks these DoTs correctly — the reference implementation for the §9 approach. The Hunter below is still
  relevant for the charge (Aimed Shot) work. **QA discipline reminder: he wants to be thorough; frame every
  build as a hypothesis to verify in-game, never as done.**
- Jason plays **Marksmanship Hunter** (**Dark Ranger** hero talents). Relevant IDs: Trick Shots buff
  **257621**, Rapid Fire **257044** (non-charge cd, works), Aimed Shot **19434** (2 charges — availability
  walled), Precise Shots **260240** (buff), **Kill Shot 53351 → override Black Arrow 466930** (Black Arrow
  replaces Kill Shot; a **1-charge** cd — see the charge learning above; his working aura = "Precise Shots
  active AND Kill Shot cd_ready"). His SavedVariables has displays incl. Trick Shots, Rapid Fire, Kill Shot,
  Aimed Shot, plus experiments. He now also has an **"MM Hunter"** group (load rule = spec).
- His active character/profile is **"Gloomvale - Stormrage"** (account folder `AELWYN`). After Phase-3 QA
  he may have leftover test profiles (e.g. "Copy Test") — harmless; deletable from the Profiles drawer.
- **Session end 2026-07-07 (third session):** shipped **Groups Phase 1** (group data + `CDM:GroupGate`
  engine, skinned name dialog) AND **Phase 2** (grouped/collapsible left pane with custom triangle +
  settings-gear icons, gear→Manage Group drawer for rename/rule/on-off/reorder/delete, group settings
  moved out of the aura editor) PLUS a **per-aura eye toggle** (`hidden/unhidden.png`). Hit + fixed the
  **Lua 5.1 60-upvalue limit** on `Build()` (extracted sub-functions). THEN added **aura rename**
  (click-to-edit title + list truncation) and the full **on-screen Text overlay** (Text drawer + font
  picker; dropped shadow — `SetShadow*` renders nothing here). All QA'd, no open bugs. `Build()` at ~57
  upvalues (watch the 60 cap). **Next: Phase 3 — Profiles.**
- **Session end 2026-07-08 (fourth session):** shipped **Profiles (Phase 3)** end to end — schema 1→2
  migration + `GA.global`/`GA.db` split (`fc41649`), then the switcher UI: bottom-strip "Profile: ‹name›"
  button → docked **Profiles drawer** (switch/new/copy/rename/delete, skinned confirm) with the full Core
  profile API (`6deae65`). Also recolored slider thumbs purple→**orange `#FF7729`** and fixed the drawer
  footer overlapping its buttons. Hit a NEW wall — the **200-locals-per-chunk** cap in `Config.lua` (chunk
  is at 198/200); worked around by hanging all profile state on the `C` table (see LEARNINGS). All QA'd
  (create/switch/delete+fallback/copy-independence), committed. THEN reworked **aura creation**: dropped
  the "pick a spell first" entry point for **appearance-first** creation — `+ Add Aura` makes a blank
  aura, spells enter via the Trigger only, and a **no-trigger aura is a decoration that's always shown**
  (Visibility-gated). All QA'd. THEN the **effects push**: fixed the **list-row mini-icon** (preview the
  aura's texture, not the tracked-spell icon), shipped **Glow** (LibCustomGlow embedded, `fa12820`), then
  **one-level grouped trigger logic** AND/OR/NONE (`1294c8f`), then re-scoped the **eye → editor preview**
  + a **Disabled/Enabled toggle** for auras & groups (`3e5d34a`) — fixing an ugly `v and nil or false`
  Lua trap along the way (see LEARNINGS) that had stranded auras disabled. Chunk 187/200 locals, `Build`
  56 upvalues. **No open bugs.** **Pushed to origin/main at session end.**
  **▶ Next: (1) QA a GROUPED trigger in combat — only flat triggers were verified. (2) Motion. (3) Frame
  & Shaping.**
- **Session end 2026-07-07 (second session):** shipped the **Hide-Blizzard-CDM toggle**, **aspect-ratio
  lock** (custom lock PNGs), **custom flat sliders**, **Duplicate Aura** (multi-per-spell via display-id
  re-key), **drag-selected-only**, **font preload** (first-login blank-label fix), a **UI-cleanup batch**
  (borderless inputs, lighter button font, Blend/Strata **dropdowns**, inline Choose, Spell-ID icon search,
  Title Case), the **docked side-panel drawer** for the editors, and fixed the **Black Arrow / 1-charge
  cooldown** tracking bug. All QA'd, committed, pushed. **No open bugs.** Next: Groups + Profiles Phase 1.

## Git / packaging
Now a **git repo** (initialized 2026-07-07). Mirrors GloomsBuildBarn's setup:
- `.gitignore` excludes `.DS_Store`, `/.release/`, `Libs/` (see below), `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- `.pkgmeta` (BigWigs packager) `package-as: GloomsAuras`; **`Libs/` is NOT committed** — the packager
  fetches LibStub/CallbackHandler/LibDataBroker/LibDBIcon/LibSharedMedia into `Libs/` at release time.
  Jason's live working copy keeps its `Libs/` (gitignore doesn't delete), so nothing breaks locally.
- **Committed** bundled art: `Media/` (fonts, `bg_flame.png`, `minimap.png`, `Textures/`,
  `TextureManifest.lua`) + `PowerAurasMedia/Auras/`. These are ours, not packager-fetched.
- **Push status:** LIVE on GitHub — https://github.com/HandofDevastation/GloomsAuras (created + pushed
  at the end of the 2026-07-07 session, after the handoff was first written). `origin` is
  `https://github.com/HandofDevastation/GloomsAuras.git`, tracking `main`. NOTE before making it public/
  wide: the repo bundles WeakAuras/PowerAuras textures (GPL-family) — fine for guild use, worth a
  license glance if published widely.
